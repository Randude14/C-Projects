Binary Coded Decimal Printer: This program takes in a max value of 0xFFFFFFFF (4294967295) from the terminal and uses bitwise operations to obtain the Binary Coded Decimal (BCD). It then prints the BCD in an old calculator display whose numbers are 5x5 wide using a single array.

Taylor Series Sin Calculator: builds an array whose values go from 0 degrees to 359 degrees with esimated sin values. These values are estimated with a taylor series of 4 terms. After building this array, it reads in degree values through the terminal or file to be interpolated and printed to the screen.
